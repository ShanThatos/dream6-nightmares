      for you to help me?
    - Rem (rem normal) ...
    - "??? (glitch rem) Nothing here matters! Don\u2019t you get it? You made it
      up! "
    - "??? (glitch rem) There isn\u2019t a town suffering from some dumb nightmares,
      it was all you."
    - "??? (glitch rem) Please, Rem, we can\u2019t keep doing this."
    - "Elio (elio normal) Whoah okay, if I and everything else wasn\u2019t glitching
      out like some buggy video game I would think Rem 2.0 was talking out of his
      behind. "
    - Elio (elio normal) Maybe you should help him out, man. Or I guess yourself?
    - 'Elio (elio normal) Just like how you did for me and Ladybird, yeah? '

    - Elio (elio normal) So uh just wondering. What would happen to me if- when you
      cleanse your nightmare realm?
    - "Rem (rem normal) Don\u2019t worry Elio, I have a feeling you will be alright."

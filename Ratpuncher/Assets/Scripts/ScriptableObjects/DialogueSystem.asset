    - Elio (elio normal) Looks like you were having a pretty nasty dream. We've got
      someone at the door right now, think you can handle it?
    - Rem (rem normal) I'll be fine, send them in.
    - "Elio (elio normal) Good mornin\u2019 ma\u2019am! Come in, come in!"
    - Elio (elio normal) It must be freezing out there- please make yourself comfortable.
    - Rem (rem normal) Welcome to NEST, my name is Rem and that is my partner Elio,
      what can we help you with today?
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) H-hello! Please call me Ladybird, I heard this was
      the place that was taking on nightmare cases?
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) I think I might be getting these dreams too. '
    - "Rem (rem normal) We can definitely help you with that, Ladybird. Can you tell
      me how has the nightmare been affecting you?\r"
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Well, it all began around the time that fog rolled
      into town about a month ago.
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) I would wake up from the nightmares in a cold sweat
      or some shivers at first but t-then it got a lot worse.
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) I started waking up to these terrible headaches
      and bruises started to appear in places I don\u2019t remember getting."
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) To be honest, I\u2019ve been a little scared to
      sleep."
    - Rem (rem normal) Can you recall anything from these nightmares? Anything that
      sticks out to you?
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Not much I\u2019m afraid."
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Only bits and pieces that reminded me of my childhood
      home, the shores, or m-maybe the pet shop I\u2019m running."
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) When I wake up though, most of everything is forgotten.
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Thank you for trusting us with your situation, Ladybird.
      I promise to do everything in my power to help you. '
    - Rem (rem normal) To do so though I need to get into your nightmare realm to
      get to the root of this issue, is that okay?
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Y-yes! Just say the word.

      Her bedroom perhaps? '

      loud at home. I wish mommy and daddy didn\u2019t fight so much. "
    - "Young Ladybird (young ladybird) If I wasn\u2019t such a bad girl they would

      one. Hmm, looks like it dropped something\u2026 a plane ticket?"
    - 'Rem (rem normal) But a fish that flies, huh? '
    - "Rem (rem normal) If this bugfish is supposed to be a manifestation of Ladybird\u2019s
      nightmare, I wonder why it took on that form?"
    - Rem (rem normal) It made itself grow wings no matter how unnatural or painful.
      What made it go to such lengths?
    - "Rem (rem normal) As if just being itself wasn\u2019t allowed. Y\u2019know,
      a fish doing fish things, or whatever fishes do. Hah."
    - "Rem (rem normal) I\u2026 I wonder if it ever felt like it was ever enough.
      To try not to disappoint by molding itself into what others wanted it to be."
    - Rem (rem normal) Is that what Ladybird felt?
    - Rem (rem normal) On some level, I think I see a little bit of myself in it.

    - Rem (rem normal) Um, Ladybird I found this in your dream realm at the end of
      the pier. It seems to be the root of your nightmares.
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Do you have an idea why?

'
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Ah, yes\u2026 that ticket was an unfilled dream
      of sorts. I always look back at it and think of what could have been. "
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) Maybe my childhood dream of wanting to explore
      the world has never truly left. '
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) I kept delaying it because I have to run the family
      business among other responsibilities.
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Looking back now, they sound like I was just making
      excuses for myself.
    - "Rem (rem normal) You shouldn\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Comfortability
      is hard to separate from for anyone."
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) I think I\u2019m ready though. It\u2019s about
      time I try and do something for myself."
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) For a while now, it seems like the only thing holding
      me back was me\u2026\n"
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) Rem, Elio, thank you so much for taking on my case.
      You have saved me in more ways than one.

    - Elio (elio normal) Looks like you were having a pretty nasty dream. We've got
      someone at the door right now, think you can handle it?
    - Rem (rem normal) I'll be fine, send them in.
    - "Elio (elio normal) Good mornin\u2019 ma\u2019am! Come in, come in! It must
      be freezing out there- please make yourself comfortable."
    - Rem (rem normal) Welcome to NEST, my name is Rem and that is my partner Elio,
      what can we help you with today?
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) H-hello! Please call me Ladybird, I heard this was
      the place that was taking on nightmare cases?
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) I think I might be getting these dreams too. '
    - 'Rem (rem normal) We can definitely help you with that, Ladybird. If you can,
      please tell me how the nightmare has been affecting you?

'
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Well, it all began around the time that fog rolled
      into town about a month ago.
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) I would wake up from the nightmares in a cold sweat
      or some shivers at first but t-then it got a lot worse.
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) I started waking up to these terrible headaches
      and bruises started to appear in places I don\u2019t remember getting."
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) T-though I think lately I\u2019ve been a little
      scared to sleep."
    - Rem (rem normal) Can you recall anything from these nightmares? Anything that
      sticks out to you?
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Only bits and pieces that reminded me of my childhood
      home, the shores, or m-maybe the pet shop I\u2019m running."
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) But when I wake up, most of everything is forgotten.
      Only the symptoms and heavy feelings linger. '
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Thank you for trusting us with your situation, Ladybird.
      I promise to do everything in my power to help you. '
    - Rem (rem normal) In order to do so though I need to get into your nightmare
      realm to get to the root of this issue, is that okay?
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Y-yes! Just say the word.
    - Rem (rem normal) I'll pin the notes for your case on my board right away!

      let''s just stick to the usual M.O: locate the core stabilizing this place
      and retrieve it. '
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Huh, this must be the childhood home Ladybird mentioned.
      Her bedroom perhaps? '

    - "Rem (rem normal) Phew- I almost thought we wouldn\u2019t see the end of that
      one. Hmm, looks like it dropped something\u2026 a plane ticket?"
    - "Rem (rem normal) But a fish that flies, huh? If this bugfish is supposed to
      be a manifestation of Ladybird\u2019s nightmare, I wonder why it took on that
      form?"
    - "Rem (rem normal)  It made itself grow wings no matter how unnatural or painful.
      What made it go to such lengths? As if just being itself wasn\u2019t allowed.
      Y\u2019know, a fish doing fish things, or whatever fishes do. Hah."
    - "Rem (rem normal) I\u2026 I wonder if it ever felt like it was ever enough.
      To try not to disappoint by molding itself into what others wanted it to be.
      Is that what Ladybird felt?"
    - Rem (rem normal) On some level, I think I see a little bit of myself in it.

      saves the day once again <3
    - "Rem (rem normal) Elio, you\u2019re so embarrassing :("
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Um, Ladybird I found this in your dream realm at the end
      of the pier. It seems to be the root of your nightmares. Do you have an idea
      why?

'
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Ah, yes\u2026 that ticket was an unfilled dream
      of sorts. I always look back at it and think of what could have been. Maybe
      my childhood dream of wanting to explore the world has never truly left. \n"
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) I kept delaying it because I have to run the family
      business, and other responsibilities but looking back they sound like I was
      making excuses for myself.
    - "Rem (rem normal) Ladybird, I don\u2019t-"
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) But! I think I\u2019m ready now. I feel like I
      can take control of my life again. My parents may have had an influence on
      me when I was younger but for a while now, it seems like the only thing holding
      me back was myself."
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Coming here made me realize that so thank you again
      for everything you\u2019ve all done for me.\n"
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) And please, take this as a token of thanks. I made
      the bread this morning so enjoy it before it gets cold! If you like it don\u2019t
      be shy to ask for more, I love baking so it\u2019s no trouble at all!\n"
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Thank you. And I wish you the best in your future endeavors.
      We are always here if you ever need a helping hand. '

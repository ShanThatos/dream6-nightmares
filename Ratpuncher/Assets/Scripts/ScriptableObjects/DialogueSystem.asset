    - "Elio (elio normal) Good mornin\u2019 ma\u2019am! Come in, come in! It must
      be freezing out there- please make yourself comfortable."
    - Rem (rem normal) Welcome to NEST, my name is Rem and that is my partner Elio,
      what can we help you with today?
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) H-hello! Please call me Ladybird, I heard this
      was the place that was taking on nightmare cases? I think I might be getting
      these dreams too. '
    - 'Rem (rem normal) We can definitely help you with that, Ladybird. If you can,
      please tell me how the nightmare has been affecting you?

'
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Well, it all began around the time that fog rolled
      into town about a month ago. I would wake up from the nightmares in a cold
      sweat or some shivers at first but t-then it got a lot worse. I started waking
      up to these terrible headaches and bruises started to appear in places I don\u2019t
      remember getting. T-though I think lately I\u2019ve been a little scared to
      sleep."
    - Rem (rem normal) Can you recall anything from these nightmares? Anything that
      sticks out to you?
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Not much I\u2019m afraid. Only bits and pieces
      that reminded me of my childhood home, the shores, or m-maybe the pet shop
      I\u2019m running but when I wake up most of everything is forgotten. Only the
      symptoms and heavy feelings linger. "
    - Rem (rem normal) Thank you for trusting us with your situation, Ladybird. I
      promise to do everything in my power to help you. In order to do so though
      I need to get into your nightmare realm to get to the root of this issue, is
      that okay?
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Y-yes! Just say the word.

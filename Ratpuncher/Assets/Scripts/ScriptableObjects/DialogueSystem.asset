      anything that I could make sense of. "

    - Rem (rem normal) Welcome to NEST, my name is Rem and that is my partner Elio,
      what can we help you with today?
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) H-hello! Please call me Ladybird, I heard this was
      the place that was taking on nightmare cases?
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) I think I might be getting these dreams too. '
    - "Rem (rem normal) We can definitely help you with that, Ladybird. Can you tell
      me how has the nightmare been affecting you?\r"
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Well, it all began around the time that fog rolled
      into town about a month ago.
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) I would wake up from the nightmares in a cold sweat
      or some shivers at first but t-then it got a lot worse.
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) I started waking up to these terrible headaches
      and bruises started to appear in places I don\u2019t remember getting."
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) To be honest, I\u2019ve been a little scared to
      sleep."
    - Rem (rem normal) Can you recall anything from these nightmares? Anything that
      sticks out to you?
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Not much I\u2019m afraid."
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Only bits and pieces that reminded me of my childhood
      home, the shores, or m-maybe the pet shop I\u2019m running."
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) When I wake up though, most of everything is forgotten.
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Thank you for trusting us with your situation, Ladybird.
      I promise to do everything in my power to help you. '
    - Rem (rem normal) To do so though I need to get into your nightmare realm to
      get to the root of this issue, is that okay?
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Y-yes! Just say the word.

    - "Rem (rem normal) If this bugfish is supposed to be a manifestation of Ladybird\u2019s
      nightmare, I wonder why it took on that form?"
    - Rem (rem normal) It made itself grow wings no matter how unnatural or painful.
      What made it go to such lengths?
    - "Rem (rem normal) As if just being itself wasn\u2019t allowed. Y\u2019know,
      a fish doing fish things, or whatever fishes do. Hah."
    - "Rem (rem normal) I\u2026 I wonder if it ever felt like it was ever enough.
      To try not to disappoint by molding itself into what others wanted it to be."
    - Rem (rem normal) Is that what Ladybird felt?
    - Rem (rem normal) On some level, I think I see a little bit of myself in it.

    - Rem (rem normal) Um, Ladybird I found this in your dream realm at the end of
      the pier. It seems to be the root of your nightmares.
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Do you have an idea why?

'
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Ah, yes\u2026 that ticket was an unfilled dream
      of sorts. I always look back at it and think of what could have been. "
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) Maybe my childhood dream of wanting to explore
      the world has never truly left. '
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) I kept delaying it because I have to run the family
      business among other responsibilities.
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Looking back now, they sound like I was just making
      excuses for myself.
    - "Rem (rem normal) You shouldn\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Comfort is hard
      to separate from for anyone."

    - "Elio (elio normal) Mm, it\u2019s not a pretty story. I- I screwed up big time
      and my team, my friends, had paid the price for it. "
    - Elio (elio normal) They trusted me and made me their leader and I let them
      down. Like a sick prank, I was the only one who made it out of that mission
      alive.
    - "Elio (elio normal) For a while, I felt that it would\u2019ve been better if
      I had died with them because then I wouldn\u2019t have to live with this overwhelming
      guilt."

      work anymore."

      that\u2019s not going so well.\r"
    - "Elio (elio normal) I hate to be a burden but y\u2019think you could maybe
      help a guy out?"
    - Elio (elio normal) Hop into my brain and fight off the scary monsters for me?
    - "Rem (rem normal) Of course, Elio. I would love to and seriously, you\u2019re
      not a bother at all."
    - 'Rem (rem normal) I wish you would rely on me more instead of stubbornly trying
      to do everything on your own. '
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Plus, I always wondered what was going on in that head of

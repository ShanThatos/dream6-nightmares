    - "Elio (elio normal) Good mornin\u2019 ma\u2019am! Come in, come in! It must
      be freezing out there- please make yourself comfortable."
    - Rem (rem normal) Welcome to NEST, my name is Rem and that is my partner Elio,
      what can we help you with today?
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) H-hello! Please call me Ladybird, I heard this
      was the place that was taking on nightmare cases? I think I might be getting
      these dreams too. '
    - 'Rem (rem normal) We can definitely help you with that, Ladybird. If you can,
      please tell me how the nightmare has been affecting you?

'
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Well, it all began around the time that fog rolled
      into town about a month ago. I would wake up from the nightmares in a cold
      sweat or some shivers at first but t-then it got a lot worse. I started waking
      up to these terrible headaches and bruises started to appear in places I don\u2019t
      remember getting. T-though I think lately I\u2019ve been a little scared to
      sleep."
    - Rem (rem normal) Can you recall anything from these nightmares? Anything that
      sticks out to you?
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) Not much I\u2019m afraid. Only bits and pieces
      that reminded me of my childhood home, the shores, or m-maybe the pet shop
      I\u2019m running but when I wake up most of everything is forgotten. Only the
      symptoms and heavy feelings linger. "
    - Rem (rem normal) Thank you for trusting us with your situation, Ladybird. I
      promise to do everything in my power to help you. In order to do so though
      I need to get into your nightmare realm to get to the root of this issue, is
      that okay?
    - Ladybird (ladybird normal) Y-yes! Just say the word.

      let''s just stick to the usual M.O: locate the core stabilizing this place
      and retrieve it. '
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Huh, this must be the childhood home Ladybird mentioned.
      Her bedroom perhaps? '

    - Rem (rem normal) Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability
      to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
    - "Rem (rem normal) But this fish tried to anyways. It tried to adapt and made
      itself grow wings no matter how unnatural or painful. I\u2026 I wonder if it
      ever felt like it was enough. To try not to disappoint by molding itself into
      what others wanted it to be."
    - Rem (rem normal) On some level, I think I see a little bit of myself in it.

    - "Rem (rem normal) Elio, you\u2019re so embarrassing :("
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Um, Ladybird I found this in your dream realm. It seems to
      be the root of your nightmares. Do you have an idea why?

'
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) Ah, yes of course. I always look back at it and
      think of what could have been. Maybe my childhood dream of wanting to explore
      the world has never truly left.

'
    - 'Ladybird (ladybird normal) I kept delaying it because I have to run the family
      business, and other responsibilities but looking back they sound like I was
      making excuses for myself.

'
    - "Rem (rem normal) Ladybird, I don\u2019t-"
    - "Ladybird (ladybird normal) But! I think I\u2019m ready now. I feel like I
      can take control of my life again. Coming here made me realize that so thank
      you again for everything you\u2019ve all done for me. And please! Take this
      as a token of thanks. Please enjoy it before it gets cold! If you like it don\u2019t
      be shy to ask for more, I love baking so it\u2019s no trouble at all!\n"
    - 'Rem (rem normal) Thank you. And I wish you the best in your future endeavors.
      We are always here if you ever need a helping hand. '
